In the published manuscript, the final heterogeneous network contains 1,020 disease nodes, as correctly reported in Table 1 and used throughout all experiments.
A single occurrence of 1,148 diseases in the manuscript text is a typographical error and does not affect data processing, model training, or experimental results.
All released code and data correspond to the correct number of 1,020 disease entities.
